# Tree

## Questions

###	What is the purpose of the data structure?
A Tree is like a linked list with nodes that are connected together by pointers. THough unlike a linked list a tree can hav multiple different nodes. 

The Advantages of a tree are that a tree reflects the data structural connections, tree is used for hierarchy, it offers an efficient search, it offers efficient insertion procedure, and tress are flexible.

###	What is the performance of the data structure (Big O)?

###	What kind of problem can be solved using the data structure?

###	How would the data structure be used in Python (recursion)?

###	What kind of errors are common when using the data structure?

###	What are the different types of trees?
There a ton of different types of trees but here are some of the major gouping of trees:
* Binary Trees
* B-trees
* Heaps
* Bit-slice trees
* Multi-way trees
* Space-partitioning trees
* Application-specific trees
###	What are nodes and how do they make a tree?

###	What are subtrees?
Well lets go over some basic tree vocab. So the top node is called the root. So a node is not connect to no other nodes is called a leaf. A parent node are a node that has connecting nodes. As a child nodes are the nodes that conect to the parent. So that leads us to What is a Subtrees? So in simple terms a subtree are any group of nodes that are left and right of the parent node.

###	Can a node have more than two branches?
Yes out side of a binary tree most trees can have more then two branches or nodes. 
The main reason I say binary tree  by deffinition is a tree that links no more than two other nodes.

###	Do trees need to be balance?
Well they don't nessaly need to be balanceed but if a tree is not balance it can really hurts the efficienty of the tree. Now what is the difference betwwen a balance and unbalcance tree? A unbalance tree is a tree that the hight is to tall for the number of data points you have. So a way to think about it is a wood plank that is balcaning on a point. Assumine that the mass of the wood plank is evenly diribluted the balance point is in the middle. So a tree needs to be like that piece of wood on said balacne point. 

## Skills

###	Know how to get the height of a tree
###	Figure out the number of nodes at each level of a tree

## Problem

###	Convert a tree into a set of linked lists
###	Find the maximum difference between a node and its descendants in a tree
