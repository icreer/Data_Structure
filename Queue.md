## Question About the Data Structure

### What is the purpose of the data structure?
Queue are very simimlar to stack. They are a linear data structure that set up data as frist in first out. So for the best example is first come frist serve in real life. So the purpose of this data structure is to set up data so there is a very distine order in how the data is used. A case I can think about is how you see a recept. The order is printed in is the frist item scanned to the last one in that order.
### What is the performance of the data structure(Big O)?
In python the Enqueue is O(1), Dequeue O(1), Front O(1), Rear O(1)
### What kind of problems can be solved using the data structure?
### How would the data structure be used in Python(recursion)?
### What kind of errors are common when using the data structure?
### Why and when do you use a Stack or queue data structure vs a Array/List?
### What is the difference between a Stack and a queue?
### Why are the difference between a stack and queue important?
### What is and what are the benefits of a Circular Queue?
